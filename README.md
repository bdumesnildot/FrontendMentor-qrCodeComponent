## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

To see how to nested some flexbox in order to vertically center some content.

To use google font import from the API, by link into the html head or by @import into the stylesheet. 
This last solution solved the CORS error issue I encountered on my first code.

### Useful resources

- [CORS error documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors) - This helped me to uderstand what was going wrong in my first code
